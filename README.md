# Simple-Neural-Network
The main idea and source codes are browsed from the" https://takinginitiative.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/basic-neural-network-tutorial-c-implementation-and-source-code/#comment-5939 "website.
In the original version of the code it was a simple neural network implenetation on c++ only for binary classification and it was supporting only 1 hidden layer, here it is upgraded to solve the multiclass classification problem and defining the nuber of the hidden layer/s and their corresponding neuron numbers.

The testing Dataset for this project is famouse iris dataset from uci repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

The project is written by visualstudio c++.
